 * GUI.java
 *
 * This class represents the GUI that will always appear for main project,
 * offering core features to the main program. The core approach to this class
 * is that it should be small, light and effective. Only core, non-specialised
 * code will be supported here.
 *
 * From a structural perspective, this class serves as a wrapper for the system
 * core functionality rather than being the system's core functionality. The
 * simulation should run effectively if this class was to be removed.
